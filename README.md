Implorted libraries and starting with the introduction part

made some crucial changes on dataset, learnt about new techniques of feature engineering today!

Plotted the heatmap for the following
Now, starting with visualizations Today

resolving errors in matplotlib library.
Going for feature engineering
..

uploaded photos

started with the algorithms.


*regression algorithms

onto the next after plotting the normal curve prediction plot for now.
getting prediction scores for them both

decision tree regressor to go!
extra-trees regressor model
going with prediction comparisions now


All done, will be writing conclusions now
